## About

Hey!!

My name is **Aron Bordin** and I’m Brazilian **researcher and freelancer**. I'm studying *Computer Science* at *São Paulo State University*, and always coding something fun on my free-time :)

I’ve been *testing new tools, documenting it and contributing to open source communities.* I can tell you that there are a lot of perfect tools, but unfortunately they still not well documented or people just don’t even know about it. :(

Currently, my main focus in on **Mobile development**; also doing some researches about **Deep Learning, Machine Learning, NLP**, and related fields. 
(I post about it on <a href="#{{ site.pages_list['Blog'] }}" class="page-scroll">my external blogs</a>).

### Background

(TL;DR)

This is an overview on what I have done so far; and my plans for the near future :)

When I was 13 or 14, I was little annoyed. I was not able to turn my Xbox Controller off when using it on Windows. I contacted support and some forums, the only solution: "*You must to remove the batteries to turn it off*". (?!) I didn't want to remove it...


#### My first coding experience

I friend of mine that was studying Computer Science told me once: "With programming, you can do anything". So, why not try to learn some programming language to turn my controller off?? 
I downloaded VS, and had my first experiences with C++ :)
Actually, it was a quite boring. In the first week, I was able to read button values from my controller, and then it becomes very exciting. After some days, I finished my first app. A GUI application to turn off the controller. The application starts with the Windows and runs on background, and then with a long press on Xbox logo, Booom! A windowed app will appear, asking if I want to turn the controller off :)

I just loved it. It was an amazing experience for me. Some simple English verbs... controlling an wireless controller...

#### My childhood dream: make an amazing game!

I had spent major part of my childhood playing games, and had always loved the idea to create my own. 

After my first experience with programming, I tried to use some game engines and code some games. Actually I developed some basic ones, using sprites and sounds from the web. But when I had an idea, I always got stuck: I was not a designer :(

#### Computer Programming - Officially

On 2012 I started a technical course about computer programming. I have always been a quite proactive; learning by myself; studying a lot of languages, a lot of tools and techniques; and then loving it more and more.

On 2013 I got my first internship. I worked with Phonegap, PHP websites/products, Python scripts, and some automation scripts at Triata. This was an amazing experience for me. I worked there for 18 months :)

#### OW! Computer Science!

On 2015, I started to study Computer Science at São Paulo State University.

#### What is the next step?

Right now I'm focused on my studies and University. I'd love to be a great Data Scientist in the near future, so I'm focusing in ML, Deep Learning, Probability, NLP and related fields right now.

Best of luck for me :)
