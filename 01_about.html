## About Me

My name is **Brian Lin** and Iâ€™m a happy hardware developer. I'm studying *Computer Science* and *Electrical and Computer Engineering* at *Duke University*. 

I love making things- music with friends, grumpy cat coasters, and sometimes even mistakes. I'm building a RoboSub as part of [Duke Robotics](http://duke-robotics.com/) and working on a study-buddy finder app with a group of friends.
