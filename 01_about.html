## About

My name is **Brian Lin** and Iâ€™m a happy software developer. I'm currently studying **Computer Science** at **Duke University** in Durham, North Carolina.

I've been building an autonomous underwater sub with the [Duke Robotics Club](http://duke-robotics.com/). We were in San Diego this past July and qualified for semi-finals our first year!

I'm also part of the HackDuke organizing team, currently working on our [landing page](https://www.hackduke.org/) and [user portal](my.hackduke.org/). Last Spring, I helped launch [Ideate Duke](https://www.hackduke.org/ideate/), a new design conference for students in the Research Triangle area.
