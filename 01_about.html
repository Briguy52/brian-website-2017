## About 

My name is **Brian Lin** and Iâ€™m a happy software developer. I'm currently studying **Computer Science** with a minor in Math at **Duke University** in Durham, North Carolina. 

I've been building an autonomous underwater sub with the [Duke Robotics Club](http://duke-robotics.com/). I'm also part of the [Hack Duke](https://www.hackduke.org/) organizing team and helped launch [Ideate Duke](https://www.hackduke.org/ideate/), Duke's first design conference, last Spring.
