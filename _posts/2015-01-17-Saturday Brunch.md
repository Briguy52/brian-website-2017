At noon today, Austin and I headed down to the Randolph kitchens to make some brunch and banana bread. Our brunch consisted of Original Stuart's HT garlic bread, sausages, and some eggs I bought on Thursday. Austin made a sort of sandwich thing with 2 slices of toasted bread topped with a fried egg, mozzarella, and sliced sausage. I went for a less-assembled approach with 3 slices of buttered garlic bread followed by 3 rounds of fried eggs and fried sliced sausage. 

Meanwhile, we also made some of my favorite banana bread recipe- [Chef John's banana bread](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2012/01/banana-bread-thats-okay-to-make-early.html). Since we didn't have access to a standard 9 x 4 loaf tin, we opted to use a 7 x 7 square tin that we had available. Since this tin was a bit shallower, we took the bread out after 60 minutes (as opposed to the recommended 70) and it was a nice light brown. Turned out just as great tasting and dense as the last 4-5 times I've made this recipe on my own.
