title: Guangzhou | China 15

Guangzhou (广州) is the third largest city in China, after Beijing and Shanghai. It is located in the south of China and the primary language spoken is Cantonese Chinese.

The downtown area is clustered with electronics shops and all sorts of inflatable advertisements. Go beyond the downtown area and you can find thick mazes of small gray houses.

I also visited the nearby Sun Yat-sen High School. A completely different place- it looks like the background for a high school anime.

Palm trees are a nice feature of southern China.

Lots and lots of green here.

There's quite a lot of lotus ponds nearby. The place we visited also offered Chinese bananas. They're still yellow, but a lot chubbier than those found in U.S. supermarkets. The flavor was similar, but had a much fuller, tangy taste that reminded me of papaya almost.
