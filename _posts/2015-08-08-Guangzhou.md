title: The China Collage Part II - Guangzhou 
---

Guangzhou (广州) is the third largest city in China, after Beijing and Shanghai. It is located in the south of China and the primary language spoken is Cantonese Chinese.

The photo above shows a stadium located next to the Guangzhou Tower (广州塔). Its reflection reminds me of a wing or fin.

Guangzhou is hot and humid. It's 闷热 - so stifling hot that a shower is warranted after every expedition outdoors. You'll see clothes hung out to dry on the balconies- this is a dorm at South China Normal University (华师大学) where I stayed for some weeks (check out that blue sky though)

The food is one of the main features of Guangzhou. There is no better way to start the day than with dim sum (飲茶) for breakfast. Steamed fish, roasted pork and duck, fresh lychee- all my favorite foods can be found in Guangzhou.

But most importantly, Guangzhou's where most of my *family* is. Grandparents and great aunts. Aunts and uncles. Lots and lots of cousins. Everyone speaks Cantonese and shares your appreciation of Cantonese food. It feels like home just as much as my dorm room at college or my neighborhood in Illinois. What a world!
