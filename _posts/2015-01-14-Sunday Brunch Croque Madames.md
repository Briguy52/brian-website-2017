The final product! Lots of cheese, pork loin bacon from the deli, fried eggs, and arugula all around.

We followed Ina Garten's [Croque Monsieur recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/croque-monsieur-recipe.html) but used shredded mozzarella instead of gruyere (would definitely use better cheese next time), made 1/2 the amount of cheese sauce (which was more than enough already), and substituted some nice Italian bread for the white sandwich bread.
