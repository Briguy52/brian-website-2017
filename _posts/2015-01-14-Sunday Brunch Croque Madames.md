Austin the Egg Expert and Gabriel, master sandwich maker, joined me in making some Croque Madame sandwiches this Sunday for brunch. The best way to describe them would be a really cheesy baked and broiled ham sandwich with an egg on top! We followed Ina Garten's [Croque Madame recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/croque-monsieur-recipe.html) with a few modifications: we used shredded <img border="5" src="http://i.imgur.com/NTOwCkV.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 30%; height: 30%; clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"/>mozzarella instead of gruyere (would definitely use better cheese next time), made 1/2 the amount of cheese sauce (which was more than enough already), and substituted some nice Italian bread for the white sandwich bread. And now for the final product! Lots of cheese, pork loin bacon from the deli, fried eggs, and arugula all around.
