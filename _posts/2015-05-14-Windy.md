Water Tower Place, in Chicago. A nice little park on Chicago Avenue with the ever-present ‘Don’t patronize the pigeons!’ signs.

An interesting trio of towers- (from left to right) The John Hancock Center, Water Tower Place’s Ritz Carlton, and The Chicago Water Work Visitor Center.

An interesting icon of the Chicago Water Works (that name just keeps bringing me back to Monopoly).

Passing by Wrigley on the way back via the Red Line ‘L’ train. It’s always fun to see the multi-story houses that stretch up almost to the edge of the stadium stands, like some brick-and-mortar siege towers.
