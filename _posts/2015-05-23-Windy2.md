I completed my first week of work at Clair Vista, LLC in Chicago. Here’s the view looking North from the Kinzie Street Bridge. Beautiful blue sky.

I then head south along Canal Street on the walk back to Union Station and I came across a familiar railroad crossing often seen from the window of the Metra. This is on Canal Street heading south.

Within an hour, the North Central Service takes me back up north to the Prairie View Station.

There’s nothing quite like an American flag.

Over the course of the week, I got some great experience with Python, Sphinx, reStructuredText, and being a part of a great software development team. This will be a great summer!
