title: Assorted Photos of January
description: ----------------------
---
To start off, we have a pair of photos of the Duke Chapel taken somewhere in the middle of the Duke forest paths (36.001, -78.939 to be exact...) on Friday, January 16t around noon (just after my Math 216 discussion). I really can't understand why, but somehow my phone managed to create an edited version of the image (or perhaps I did while asleep- I have no idea). But anyways, I decided to include the black and white cropped version because it looks nice- almost like something you'd find on a postcard in the (always overpriced) Duke University Book Store.

Both pictures (as are all others until noted) are/were taken with my OnePlus One's 13mp 3.79mm focal length back facing camera. All these nice looking pictures are coming from the 'HDR' feature which does some sort of slow-shutter setting.

Next, we have a shot of the Bell Tower dorm (the newest freshman dorm) and a tree trunk in the Duke chapel forest area trails.
