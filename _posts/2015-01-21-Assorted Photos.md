We have a photo of the Duke Chapel taken somewhere in the middle of the Duke chapel forest paths (36.001, -78.939 to be exact) on Friday, January 16t around noon (just after my Math 216 discussion). Next to that is a textured tree trunk in the same general area.

All pictures (as are all others until noted) are/were taken with my OnePlus One's 13mp 3.79mm focal length back facing camera. The crisper looking pictures are coming from the 'HDR' feature in the Cyanogen camera app.
