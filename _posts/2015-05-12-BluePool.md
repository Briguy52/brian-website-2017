Ahh, Photoshop, welcome back my old friend. Itâ€™s been a while since I last head-swapped Facebook photos during Sophomore year of high school. Today, I re-familiarized myself with how Layers work by creating a Black and White layer of an image and then selectively restoring the color to the blue pool table felt. Very cool look!
