title: Restaurant Review - Joy Yee's
---


Joy Yee’s is a Chicago-area sit-down casual restaurant, known for their Bubble Tea and other drinks. There are several locations scattered about. I’ve previously been to the Chinatown location (both before and after renovation) but this was my first time visiting the Evanston spot.

The menu is very, very large, both in sheer size and offerings. Standard entree item prices begin in the low teens, but the lunch specials that I normally order cost between 7-10. Portion sizes are very large and can easily be shared between two people.

Joy Yee’s is arguably best known for their drinks. Most popular are the different varieties of Bubble Teas and Fruit Freezes. Bubble Tea is iced milk tea with chewy tapioca pearls added, but you can also add all sorts of different flavorings, fruits, and toppings. Fruit Freezes are similar to smoothies, but have a less of a dairy taste and a stronger icy/fruity flavor. My Milk Tea was presented in a very tall and striking glass tankard. I ordered a Mango Milk Tea, which had an odd sour flavor that I did not enjoy. Next time I will either order a Mango Fruit Freeze or a plain Bubble Tea. 

Entrees come with a small bowl of hot and sour soup as well as a spring roll. This is one of the few spring rolls I actually enjoy. It comes with a small dish of sweet and sour dipping sauce. If you’re looking for a really authentic and cheap Chinese place, I recommend you try out some of the restaurants in Chinatown Square. However, Joy Yee’s has some amazing drinks, an open modern atmosphere, and is a great place to bring less-adventurous guests.
