title: Zhongshan | China 15

Zhongshan (中山) is a city in the south of China. It's a 45 minute bullet train (高铁) ride from Guangzhou's main train station.

The downtown area is clustered with electronics shops and all sorts of inflatable advertisements. Go beyond the downtown area and you can find thick mazes of small gray houses.

I also visited the nearby Sun Yat-Sen High School. This places looks unreal! It's like the backdrop of a Japanese high school drama or anime.

There's an a random boat in the pond!

Lots and lots of green here.

The sign at the front entrance.

There's quite a lot of lotus ponds nearby. The place we visited also offered Chinese bananas. They're still yellow, but a lot chubbier than those found in U.S. supermarkets. The flavor was similar, but had a much fuller, tangy taste that reminded me of papaya almost.
