Most people are familiar with the standard 14k or 18k Vanishing Point pens produced by Pilot. New ones generally run for around $120-140 online. 

However, Pilot also produces a ‘Special Alloy’ steel nib Capless that is only available domestically in Japan, retailing for around $70. This is a review of that pen.
