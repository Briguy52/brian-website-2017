For dinner today, Pim and I made some Chinese steamed buns (bao zi)! These were made very similarly to the potstickers last week- just with the addition of yeast to the dough (which then proofed for an hour in a nice warm oven). I must say though- wrapping the bao zi was quite a challenge for me (luckily Pim got it down really quickly). The filling was cabbage, green onions, soy sauce, oil, salt, and ground pork like always. This recipe was based on The Woks of Life's [Carrot Ginger Pork Buns: Two Ways](http://thewoksoflife.com/2014/06/carrot-ginger-pork-buns/), but without the carrot, ginger, and some other ingredients I didn't have around. 

My [TWSBI Diamond 580](http://www.twsbi.com/) fountain pen arrived a week or so ago. It took a while to get used to, but I'm liking it much more after a week of solid use. I was initially concerned about the nib, comparing it to the hooded nib on my old Golden Star 703 (Medium). The problem was that I thought that nib was a fine, and so ordered a nib on the TWSBI. It's great, but just not as wet and smooth as I would like. But, ah, no problem- it's a gorgeous pen and a pleasure to use. So far, I've filled it with two ink combinations: Noodler's Turquoise/ Noodler's Black mix and then Diamine Violet/ Noodler's Black mix (I like my inks dark). Both perform great and look great in the demonstrator barrel of the pen. I would also like to mention Leo Fok from the ['Leo Reviews'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZYzw-o5p0) series on YouTube- I love his casual cafe fountain pen reviews and his review of this pen (especially the look of the J. Herbin Violet inside...) really swayed me buy this great pen!
