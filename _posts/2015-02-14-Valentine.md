Here's a nice shot of Bell Tower yesterday afternoon, when it was really nice out. I was just heading out for a haircut (I seem to have settled into a rate of 0.5 haircuts/ month) and took a little stop on my way to take some pictures and breathe in the nice day outside. 

I'm currently trying to learn the Celsius scale. No, not by converting numbers in my head, but I've configured my phone to only give my Celsius readings so that I can walk outside and say, 'So this is what 4 feels like!' (or something like that- I don't actually do things like that). In any way, I got a reading of about 19 degrees Celsius and then to get a Farenheit reading, I pulled out Snapchat, turned on the 'precise location' setting and got a temperature of 63 degrees! Very nice- perfect for running. Which is what I did afterwards. Did a short loop from East Campus to WA Duke (no Al Buehler trail today) and came back in time for dinner with Gabe and Austin.
