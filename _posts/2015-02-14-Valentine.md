For dinner today, Pim and I made some Chinese steamed buns (bao zi)! These were made very similarly to the potstickers last week- just with the addition of yeast to the dough (which then proofed for an hour in a nice warm oven). I must say though- wrapping the bao zi was quite a challenge for me (luckily Pim got it down really quickly). The filling was cabbage, green onions, soy sauce, oil, salt, and ground pork like always. This recipe was based on The Woks of Life's [Carrot Ginger Pork Buns: Two Ways](http://thewoksoflife.com/2014/06/carrot-ginger-pork-buns/), but without the carrot, ginger, and some other ingredients I didn't have around. 

Breakfast/brunch today consisted of another round of Gabriel's awesome [Almond Challah Bread French Toast](http://www.nmlin.org/2015/01/18/Challah%20Challah%20Big%20Dolla%20Chevy%20Impala%20French%20Toast.html). Although we didn't have fresh raspberries, I thought they came out even better this time! (We also cut them a bit thinner which must have helped with cooking consistently throughout). Meanwhile, Austin and I baked a batch of Pumpkin Muffins and Pumpkin bread. After chiseling open the pumpkin puree can with a butter knife and a skillet (with proper lab safety procedures of course...), I don't think I'll be able to walk past a can opener in a grocery store.
