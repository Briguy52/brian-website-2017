Hot air balloon rides on East Campus! What a day!

It’s powered by one giant flamethrower (gotta love the reaction of all the people around me when he first turned it on… screams, shouts, and steps back haha).

And the view from the top- East Campus quad, Baldwin side. We didn’t go that high up, but rising above Lily Library and seeing the setting sun splash its light over the roof- breathtaking!
