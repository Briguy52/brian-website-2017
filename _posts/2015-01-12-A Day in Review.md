Another rainy day here in Durham. You can always tell the day's going to be poor when you have to navigate through or around the Randolph puddle. 

Regardless, I headed over to Brodie for the second week of Wendler 5/3/1 as an alternative to the Stronglifts 5Ã—5 program I did last semester. Squats, shoulder press, and dips today.

Good ol' Alfred Goshaw and his Physics 151 demonstrations - gotta love them. He does weekly talks on his work at CERN and the Large Hadron Collider (27km circumference). Definitely gotta find some time to listen.
