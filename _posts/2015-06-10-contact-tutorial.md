The contact part of the index page is consisted of two elements:

<ol>
  <li>Text</li>
  <li>Your email address</li>
</ol>

You can modify its text from the contact.html file.
Then in the _config.yml set the email variable to your email.

Don't be afraid of Email Harvesting, write your email properly, and the page will perform javascript obfuscation.
