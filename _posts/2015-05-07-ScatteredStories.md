Well, it’s been a short year and a long year. I can hardly remember the first time I practiced my ‘Randolph-puddle-parkour’ to avoid the waters that would strategically cover the entire entrance to the archway. More recently, with North Carolina’s pollen storms, all of Duke’s puddles, this one included, received curious whitish-yellow swirls of the allergy-inducing stuff. On the topic of pollen, I must include an exchange I happened to eavesdrop upon on move-out day (note: not accurate word-for-word):

>Daughter: Mom, see all that yellow stuff along the wall? That’s pollen!

>Mom: What’s pollen?

>Daughter: It’s the stuff that bees make!

As you can see, Duke is a very diverse school, in more ways than one.

Ah, the rain. April truly lives up to its rhyme as Gabriel discovered coming back drenched from West Campus.

While I do love Winter as my favorite season, the sunlight and warmth of Spring is always welcome. Here is a bright sunset piercing through some Springtime blossoms outside of Brodie Gym on East Campus.

Walking down Broad Street on the way to work, I had to stop to smell (and take some pictures) of the flowers growing in a roadside garden. Tulips always remind me of home and these orange ones have a lovely pinkish-orange ‘salmon’ color.
