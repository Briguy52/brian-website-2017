Well, it’s been a short year and a long year. I can hardly remember the first time I practiced my ‘Randolph-puddle-parkour’ to avoid the waters that would strategically cover the entire entrance to the archway. More recently, with North Carolina’s pollen storms, all of Duke’s puddles, this one included, received curious whitish-yellow swirls of the allergy-inducing stuff.

Ah, the rain. April truly lives up to its rhyme as Gabriel discovered coming back drenched from West Campus.

While I do love Winter as my favorite season, the sunlight and warmth of Spring is always welcome. Here is a bright sunset piercing through some Springtime blossoms outside of Brodie Gym on East Campus.

Walking down Broad Street on the way to work, I had to stop to smell (and take some pictures) of the flowers growing in a roadside garden. Tulips always remind me of home and these orange ones have a lovely pinkish-orange ‘salmon’ color.

Another shot of the garden- a nice reprieve to have along busy Broad Street.

Over on West Campus, here’s a beautiful blue sky drifting in the back behind some white cherry blossoms.

A different view- this time including the stone of the Divinity School.

A beautiful urban church (Asbury Methodist) located just at the Northern edge of East Campus.

A sky bound telephone pole, standing tall amongst the trees.

Deep-fried okra courtesy of master chef Austin. Surprisingly not slimy (unlike previous okra experiences)! 

<img alt="Photo: Buckingham Palace" src="http://nmlin.org/Images/2015.05.07/bot.jpg" style="max-width:630px;">

My super mish-mash BOE-bot built for my Electrical and Computer Engineering lab! My favorite features are the chopstick photo resistor arm, the attached Japan-esque lampshade, and the gratuitous zipties.

A subdued shot of the ABP outdoor fireplace.

The art building with a door as decorated with stickers and posters as the back of a college student’s MacBook pro.

Interesting graffiti. Part of a little riddle game I had with Gabe and Austin.

Ah, GA Down Under. What a magnificent place. Wish I could have come here more often.

<img alt="Photo: Buckingham Palace" src="http://nmlin.org/Images/2015.05.07/panko.jpg" style="max-width:630px;">

Panko-breaded chicken parmesan! Very tasty, but damn that Harris Teeter chicken breast was the toughest thing ever.

It’s been a great semester, see you this Fall!
