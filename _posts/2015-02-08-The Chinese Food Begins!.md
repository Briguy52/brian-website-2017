Today, Austin and I made some potstickers and green onion pancakes (葱油饼)! We adapted our potstickers from [this recipe](http://thewoksoflife.com/2014/11/easiest-pork-and-cabbage-potstickers-ever/) from TheWoksOfLife. The dough was simply all-purpose flour kneaded together with water (Austin went by feel- no exact amounts). While the kneaded dough sat, we created the filling: finely chopped cabbage, ground pork, oil, soy sauce, salt, and green onions. We then placed them in a hot pan, added water, covered, and then took them out after the water evaporated and the potstickers got a nice sear. 

Here's some more detailed pictures of the cooking process and final result:

Using leftover dumpling filling, we made some stuffed green onion pancakes and meatballs. We simply added some extra salt, soy sauce, and green onions to the filling. Once again, the dough was water and flour, but with a bit of oil added. It was quite fun rolling these up and then flattening them into the cool spiral patterns.

On Saturday, we also made some homemade noodles that we served with miso soup (quick note: add 1 more cup of water next time after noodles are 'infused' with the soup!). To start off our soup, we used cues from [JustOneCookbook's Miso Ramen recipe](http://www.justonecookbook.com/recipes/homemade-chashu-miso-ramen/) and cooked some ground pork and garlic in a skillet for flavor. We then added in some spoonfuls of miso paste that I got from Li Ming's the day before (that 9.25 mile run was worth it haha). For our soup, we used about 2 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups of water with some soy sauce and the miso/pork/garlic mixture. The final product was great! Only complaints would be 1. not enough soup (more like a sauce than a soup) and 2. a bit too salty for our tastebuds. But a great first time making noodles and soup nonetheless!
