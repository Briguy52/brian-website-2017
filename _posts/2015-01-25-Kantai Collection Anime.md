Kantai Collection (KanColle) is a pretty good Anime so far based on the first 3 episodes. A lot of the interpersonal interactions reminded me a lot of K-On! and the action bits seem to be similar to Strike Witches (though my experience with Strike Witches has been limited to playing through one song in Osu!...) 

Anyways, there's already been some 'deep' moments, enough Shimakaze/Kongou kameos to keep me happy, and as mentioned before, decent action. Nothing like Samurai Champloo/ Psycho Pass/ Durarara/ Cowboy Bebop/ Darker than Black (some of my favorite action Anime) but still action that I can enjoy. 

Pictured above is a really nice still frame artwork from Episode 2 done by Pixiv artist [bob](http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=91521), one of my favorites.
