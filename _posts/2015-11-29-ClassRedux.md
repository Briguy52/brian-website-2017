Here's a brief overview of the classes I took this semester and my thoughts on them.

* Math 353 - Differential Equations 

* Physics 152 - Electromagnetics

* CompSci 201 - Data Structures and Algorithms

* ECE 280 - Signals and Systems

* AMES 361 - East Asian Youth Culture

The problem with engineering is that whenever you sign up for a class, you don't just sign up for the lecture. You also get the discussion and the lab! That means a busy busy schedule (as you can tell from my Wednesdays...)

What did I think about the classes I took? 

**Math 353 with Prof. Michael Abel** - this was math how I like it! Highschool-like class size and the professor stops for questions regularly, is approachable, understanding, and takes the time to explain things clearly.  

**Physics 152 with Prof. Philip Barbeau** - lectures were interesting... but not very practical since the lofty deep physics stuff covered in lecture never really showed up on the homework, quizzes, or tests. Discussion was nice though- Prof. Shailesh did a great job covering and reviewing topics on the blackboard. 

**CompSci 201 with Prof. Jeffery Forbes** - a great class for learning how to program. I learned **a lot**. Prof. Forbes was pretty informative and very funny. Discussion was not that useful. I think it's been a while since I took a class and was like "this is stuff I can actually use right now". What a great feeling.

**ECE 280 with Prof. Leslie Collins** - best taken alongside Differential Equations! This class is essentially applications of DiffEq. You do Fourier Transforms, impulse functions, and all of that stu The textbook gives poor examples, the homework is graded like it's an exam, and I find myself getting lost in the lectures. Luckily, the labs made up for the rest of the class. My TA was seriously amazing and we got to do cool things like building an AM radio or decoding phone dial tones.

**AMES 361 with Prof. Dwayne Dixon** - classwise, this is probably the highlight of my week! (other than the weekend) I really miss discussion style classes when all I take are engineering lectures and this was a great break from the rest of my schedule. Topics were varied and interesting, Korean gamers, hostess clubs, precarious labor, and I got to discuss these themes with a bunch of just as interesting and varied people. Only thing is that I added on this extra class (students normally only take 4) expecting it to be lax... and that was the wrong mindset to take. THat's on my end though and I highly recommend this class and professor.
