Wordsreakfast/brunch today consisted of another round of Gabriel’s awesome Almond Challah Bread French Toast. Although we didn’t have fresh raspberries, I thought they came out even better this time! (We also cut them a bit thinner which must have helped with cooking consistently throughout). Meanwhile, Austin and I baked a batch of Pumpkin Muffins and Pumpkin bread. After chiseling open the pumpkin puree can with a butter knife and a skillet (with proper lab safety procedures of course…), I don’t think I’ll be able to walk past a can opener in a grocery store.
