Walk down Chicago Avenue, almost to Lake Shore Drive. Find a pair of heavy wooden doors. Go in. Downstairs. Northwestern Law School.

A beautiful courtyard. Some grads came in later to shoot some photos in their silky purple gowns.

This funny looking guy must also be graduating.

This was a very interesting building, and only one part of the larger Law School. There was a very old and antiquated Lincoln Hall and long, hardwood-paneled hallways. Yet on the older side of the building was a completely different world- spacious, modern lounges and study areas. On the second floor, across from the library was a glass walled conference room. Wow, what a cool place to be!
