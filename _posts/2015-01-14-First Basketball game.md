Got to see some great shots, hear some great cheers, and take some (somewhat) great pictures at the Duke vs. Miami basketball game this Tuesday evening in Cameron Indoor Stadium. Friends had the stele to line up all day in shifts starting at 11 am (and for that I'm very grateful) so we got some amazing 2nd row seats! I joined them after work around 6:30 pm and the group of us stood outside, inside, during the game... until it was over, around 11 pm!
