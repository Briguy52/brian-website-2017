title: First Basketball Game!
---
Got to see some great shots, hear some great cheers, and take some (somewhat) great pictures at the Duke vs. Miami basketball game this Tuesday evening in Cameron Indoor Stadium. <img border="5" src="http://i.imgur.com/bY3hbog.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"/> Friends had the stele to line up all day in shifts starting at 11 am (and for that I'm very grateful) so we got some amazing 2nd row seats! I joined them after work around 6:30 pm and the group of us stood outside, inside, during the game... until it was over, around 11 pm!
