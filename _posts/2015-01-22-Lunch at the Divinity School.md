A (greasy) but delicious lunch. With tax, it ended up being somewhere between 7 and 8. A bit more expensive than Panda and 1 to 2 more than a Twinnie's Chicken Pita, but good nonetheless. I thought the soup had a nice balance of sourness and creaminess, making it go pretty well with the grilled cheese.

That's the view from the 2nd floor balcony area of the Divinity School, looking out towards FCIEMAS. I usually get a similar perspective from the 4th floor of Perkins.

One of my favorite parts about the Divinity School is this nice long white hallway. The arches almost look like the ceiling of some carved snow cave to me.

Here's the stained glass window at the end of the hallway (it's to my back in the picture above).

Duke Chapel - Divinity School side. Wow, what a view! The tower going up to the sky, the white clouds at the top giving way to the blue sky below, and the stone sides of the chapel itself.

During ECE lab this morning, I got to mess around with a BOE-bot. The robot that Josh and I got was a bit finicky... it only went in reverse and the QTI sensors seemed to be acting up. Regardless, it was nice to get to work with an Arduino again (I say that even though I have one in my dorm room...) and do so with some other fun people.

After lunch and ECE lab, I took an hour-long nap around noon. There's a little crescent arrangement of benches outside the 2nd floor entrance to the Schiciano atrium where I got to lie down (the picture above was my view of the sky). It's a decently quiet place, other than the squirrels rustling in the bushes around me.

Here's an interesting picture of some tree roots outside FCIEMAS.

Forest lining. It was very nice out today (once again) and there's nothing better to do than take a walk through the forest, even if that walk ends up leading you to Physics lab.
