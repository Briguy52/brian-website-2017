title: Canon Store | China 15

Canon is one of the most well-known modern camera manufacturers. Throughout major Chinese cities, you can find Canon stores in high-end shopping areas.

Canon (キヤノン株式会社) is a Japanese company that makes other imaging products (such as printers, fax machines, etc.) However, their most notable consumer product would be the Canon camera. As a natural extension of the product, the act of *photography* is the focus of the store.

You can find DSLR cameras mounted on stands throughout the store. There are also various household items placed on tables, shelves, and other everyday settings. It almost reminds me of a galaxy or solar system! Photography is made easy with a combination of natural sunlight from the wide glass storefront as well as the ceiling lights.

To further reinforce the idea that this is a photography store, not just a consumer products store, the staff have a special section dedicated to workshops. When we entered to escape the Shanghai rain, there was a full crowd of around twenty people seated in front of a projector and several Canon staff.

All these different elements remind me of the Apple Stores, which happen to be the most efficient stores in the world, measured in revenue per square foot. The key is the amount of control possible with presentation and service. And Canon stores do a great job at both of those- creating a warm and well-curated environment that I enjoyed exploring and photographing.
