This is a writeup of the **Pilot Vanishing Point ‘Special Alloy’ Fountain Pen**

<img alt="Photo: Vanishing Point" src="http://nmlin.org/Images/Vanishing/1.jpg" style="max-width:630px;">

Most people are familiar with the standard 14k or 18k Vanishing Point pens produced by Pilot. New ones generally run for around $120-140 online. 

However, Pilot also produces a ‘Special Alloy’ steel nib Capless that is only available domestically in Japan, retailing for around $70. This is a review of that pen.

####Anticipated Questions

**How does this compare to the gold nib Pilot Vanishing Point?** 
I don’t own any gold nib pens so I can’t offer any insight. If I’m able to acquire one, I will update this post with that information.

**How long did it take to ship?**
Via EMS, about 3 days. Note that it takes a day or two to communicate with the retailer after you submit the order to work out shipping and all that. But once it’s shipped and I received a tracking number, it took about 3 days for the package to travel from Japan to Chicago.

**Who did you buy it from and would you recommend them?**
I went with ‘Komamono Honpo’ on Rakuten. Yes, I would definitely recommend them but with one caveat (see end of this post).

**Do you like this pen? Would you buy it again if you lost it?**
Yes I like this pen. I would buy it again if I lost it.

####Aesthetics and Design

If you’ve ever used a standard Vanishing Point, you’ve used this pen. The only difference between both models lies in the nib (covered in a later section). When I was looking at Vanishing Point reviews, it seemed that everybody had some matte VP variant, be it the Gunmetal Grey or the full-black Stealth. Those pens look amazing, so of course, I wanted one of those as well. However, these steel-nibbed Vanishing Points *only* come in Lacquered finishes, so I reluctantly bought the Black Lacquered model with Rhodium trim. That was a great decision. 

This is a a beautiful, shiny, yet professional-looking pen. The Rhodium accents offer some eye-catching highlights without becoming gaudy, raven-attracting bling. The black lacquered body offers a wonderfully polished reflective surface. When I’m sitting in my office, there are body-length silver streaks from the fluorescent lights above me. Raden Stripes anyone? When I’m sketching on the train, I can see buildings and night lights blur by. Raden Galaxy anyone? When I’m sitting by a window on a sunny day, it takes on facets of light and greyscale shades. Raden Water anyone? Okay, that’s all a bit of a stretch, but this is a very good looking pen. In addition to this Black model, Pilot also offers the steel nib Capless in Silver, Yellow, and perhaps some other colors (all with Rhodium trim). Now if only they made lacquered Metropolitans…

####Durability and Construction

I’ll start with the case. Most people are familiar with the big square ‘suspended in air’ VP cases or the simpler cardboard pen boxes. My VP came in a very rugged molded plastic case that I've never seen before, but very similar in construction to your typical glasses case. I wouldn’t say it looks nice- there’s an odd indentation where the case closes that just looks strange to me (it closes perfectly fine and securely though). If for whatever reason you like to carry around pens in their original packaging, this one will protect it well. I personally don’t care about the packaging as long as it protects the pen during shipping, so I’m more than satisfied with this.

This pen feels solid and the fit and finish is top notch. The trim isn’t loose, the clip is secure, and the entire pen feels like one solid unit. The main concern people have with the Capless is that the trapdoor may lose its airtight seal over time. I cannot comment on that as I’ve only owned the pen for a weekend. 

My pen preferences lean to heavy, modern-looking, metal pens. This pen checks off all of those boxes so I’m a happy customer. I was considering the equally priced Custom 74 for its gold nib, but being a light, cigar-shaped, plastic pen it was the complete opposite of what I wanted. 

Like the Lamy Safari, this pen tries to force you to conform to the ‘standard’ tripod grip. I refuse. I have this overhand grip where my pointer finger rests on top, inline with the nib. My thumb and middle finger form some strange tripod on either flank. I just place my pointer finger on top of the clip, thumb and middle finger where they normally go, and all is fine for me. I do pretty much the same thing with the Safari and it doesn’t bother me much. Would I prefer the clip somewhere else or removed entirely? Yes, but not enough to dissuade me from purchasing the pen.

####Writing Experience

The defining feature of this pen is that it features a ‘special alloy’ (i.e. steel) nib, compared to the standard gold nib Vanishing Points. While the nib is presumably steel, it has a gold color. I would have preferred a silver colored nib, especially in this pen.

The nib arrived rather dry. I bought this for the purpose of sketching and use textured drawing paper. If you’re wondering why I use that paper, it’s because I like to go over my drawings with a water brush for a sort of water color effect. Out of the box, this pen skipped when making long strokes on my drawing paper. With some adjustment (‘flexing’ the nib slightly against the body of a Jinhao x750), I was able to make this pen a wetter writer. Now, there’s not a sign of skipping- on my drawing paper, Rhodia pad, or Xerox office paper. Good!

Is this a ‘super smooth’ writer? No. Out of all my fountain pens, my Lamy Safari (fine) has yet to be dethroned as my smoothest writer. I would compare the smoothness of this nib (post adjustment) to my TWSBI Diamond 580 (fine), Pilot Metro (fine), or Pilot Petit1 (fine). I plan on buying a four sided buffing stick to smooth this in the future. 

Overall, it offers a decent writing experience that I can’t complain about (post-adjustment).

####Filling System

This pen comes with a Pilot black ink cartridge in addition to an empty cartridge with a nice steel sleeve. I know some models come with a CON-50 converter, but this one didn’t. That’s fine with me since the CON-50 holds less ink than a cartridge and I fill all my converters with a syringe anyway.

The metal sleeve is a nice touch. The VP works perfectly fine with or without it, and it technically slows down your cartridge-refilling process, but I love that it’s there. When I screw open the pen, all I can see is stainless steel and that makes me inexplicably happy.

####Value and Overall Impressions

I purchased this pen from the Rakuten seller ‘Komamono-Honpo’ as part of a larger order. The pen itself costs $71 plus shipping. My total order consisted of:

* One Pilot Capless Fine fountain pen

* Two bottles of Iroshizuku Ink (Murasaki-Shikibu and Take-Sumi)

* Two bottles of Sailor Jentle Four Seasons Ink (Souten and Oku-Yama)

* One bottle of Pilot Red (30mL) Ink 

* Four Pilot Petit1 pocket fountain pens

And this came out to a **grand total of $134**, shipped within 3 days from Japan to Chicago. That’s around the price of a brand new gold Vanishing Point! If I were to choose between a gold nib upgrade or five bottles of ink and four excellent pocket pens, I’d take the ink and pens any day. 

Also, keep in mind that you can order a replacement gold nib unit for around $65! I may consider buying a Medium gold nib for journaling and note-taking in the future. 

####Alternatives to Consider

As a side note, there are some other very noteworthy pens to consider purchasing from Rakuten that are similar to this one. 

The **Pilot Decimo** is the slimmer, Japan and Europe-only cousin to the Vanishing Point. It weighs in at around 20g and offers a slimmer profile, while still maintaining the gold nib unit of the standard Vanishing Point. These cost around $100 on Rakuten. 

The **Pilot Fermo** is a classier version of the Vanishing Point, at least in my opinion. It offers a twist mechanism, is even heavier than the VP, and retails for around $140 on Rakuten.   

And finally, the **Pilot Custom 74** features a gold nib for around $70. If you place a lot of importance on writing experience, I would recommend this over the Steel Capless (at least when it comes to $70 pens from Rakuten). 

####Note on Buying from Rakuten

If you weren’t aware, the buying process is as follows:

1. Go on preferred retailer’s website and add items to your cart.

2. Enter in your payment and shipping info. Submit your order.

3. Retailer calculates the shipping cost (based off of weight) and emails you a confirmation email with the shipping cost. 

4. You either reply to confirm or ignore it. 

5. After you confirm, they send you the tracking info.

6. Wait a couple days and receive your package. 

Packaging is very good and the order came in very quickly (especially considering that this is from Japan to Chicago). The outer box contained a smaller box with a layer of bubble wrap sandwiched between. Within the smaller box was all my items individually bubble wrapped. I could probably toss this down the stairs and not break a single bottle of ink. Very impressed.
