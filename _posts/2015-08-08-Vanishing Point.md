This is a writeup of the Pilot Vanishing Point ‘Special Alloy’ Fountain Pen

Most people are familiar with the standard 14k or 18k gold Vanishing Point pens produced by Pilot. New ones generally run for around $120-140 online. 

However, Pilot also produces a ‘Special Alloy’ steel nib Capless that is only available domestically in Japan, retailing for around $70. This is a review of that pen.

This is a a beautiful, shiny, professional-looking pen. The Rhodium accents offer some eye-catching highlights without becoming gaudy, raven-attracting bling. The black lacquered body offers a wonderfully polished reflective surface. When I’m sitting in my office, there are body-length silver streaks from the fluorescent lights above me.  When I’m sketching on the train, I can see buildings and night lights blur by. When I’m sitting by a window on a sunny day, it takes on facets of light and greyscale shades. This is a very good looking pen that shines (quite literally) in that black polished mirror finish. In addition to this Black model, Pilot also offers the steel nib Capless in Silver, Yellow, and perhaps some other colors (all with Rhodium trim).

This pen feels solid and the fit and finish is top notch. The trim isn’t loose, the clip is secure, and the entire pen feels like one solid unit. The main concern people have with the Capless is that the trapdoor may lose its airtight seal over time. I cannot comment on that as I’ve only owned the pen for a weekend. 

My pen preferences lean to heavy, modern-looking, metal pens. This pen checks off all of those boxes so I’m a happy customer. I was considering the equally priced Custom 74 for its gold nib, but being a light, cigar-shaped, plastic pen it was the complete opposite of what I wanted. 

Like the Lamy Safari, this pen tries to force you to conform to the ‘standard’ tripod grip. I refuse. I have this overhand grip where my pointer finger rests on top, inline with the nib. My thumb and middle finger form some strange tripod on either flank. I just place my pointer finger on top of the clip, thumb and middle finger where they normally go, and all is fine for me. I do pretty much the same thing with the Safari and it doesn’t bother me much. Would I prefer the clip somewhere else or removed entirely? Yes, but not enough to dissuade me from purchasing the pen.

The defining feature of this pen is that it features a ‘special alloy’ (i.e. steel) nib, compared to the standard gold nib Vanishing Points. While the nib is presumably steel, it has a gold color. I would have preferred a silver colored nib, especially in this pen.

The nib arrived rather dry. I bought this for the purpose of sketching and use textured drawing paper. If you’re wondering why I use that paper, it’s because I like to go over my drawings with a water brush for a sort of water color effect. Out of the box, this pen skipped when making long strokes on my drawing paper. With some adjustment (‘flexing’ the nib slightly against the body of a Jinhao x750), I was able to make this pen a wetter writer. Now, there’s not a sign of skipping- on my drawing paper, Rhodia pad, or Xerox office paper. Good!

Is this a ‘super smooth’ writer? No. Out of all my fountain pens, my Lamy Safari (fine) has yet to be dethroned as my smoothest writer. I would compare the smoothness of this nib (post adjustment) to my TWSBI Diamond 580 (fine), Pilot Metro (fine), or Pilot Petit1 (fine). I plan on buying a four sided buffing stick to smooth this in the future. 

Overall, it offers a decent writing experience that I can’t complain about (post-adjustment).

I purchased this pen from the Rakuten seller ‘Komamono-Honpo’ as part of a larger order. The pen itself costs $71 plus shipping. My total order consisted of:

	One Pilot Capless Fine fountain pen

	Two bottles of Iroshizuku Ink (Murasaki-Shikibu and Take-Sumi)

	Two bottles of Sailor Jentle Four Seasons Ink (Souten and Oku-Yama)

	One bottle of Pilot Red (30mL) Ink 

	Four Pilot Petit1 pocket fountain pens

And this came out to a **grand total of $134**, shipped within 3 days from Japan to Chicago. That’s around the price of a brand new gold Vanishing Point! If I were to choose between a gold nib upgrade or five bottles of ink and four excellent pocket pens, I’d take the ink and pens any day. 

If you weren’t aware, the buying process is as follows:

	Go on preferred retailer’s website and add items to your cart.

	Enter in your payment and shipping info. Submit your order.

	Retailer calculates the shipping cost (based off of weight) and emails you a confirmation email with the shipping cost. 

	You either reply to confirm or ignore it. 

	After you confirm, they send you the tracking info.

	Wait a couple days and receive your package. 

Packaging is very good and the order came in very quickly (especially considering that this is from Japan to Chicago). The outer box contained a smaller box with a layer of bubble wrap sandwiched between. Within the smaller box was all my items individually bubble wrapped. I could probably toss this down the stairs and not break a single bottle of ink. Very impressed.
