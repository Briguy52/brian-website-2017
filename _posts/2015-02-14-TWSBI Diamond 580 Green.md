description: One pretty turquoise fountain pen!
---

My [TWSBI Diamond 580](http://www.twsbi.com/) fountain pen arrived a week or so ago. It took a while to get used to, but I'm liking it much more after a week of solid use. I was initially concerned about the nib, comparing it to the hooded nib on my old Golden Star 703 (Medium). The problem was that I thought that nib was a fine, and so ordered a nib on the TWSBI. It's great, but just not as wet and smooth as I would like. But it's a gorgeous pen and a pleasure to carry around. So far, I've filled it with two ink combinations: Noodler's Turquoise/ Noodler's Black mix and then Diamine Violet/ Noodler's Black mix (I like my inks dark). Both perform great and look great in the demonstrator barrel of the pen. I would also like to mention Leo Fok from the ['Leo Reviews'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZYzw-o5p0) series on YouTube- I love his casual cafe fountain pen reviews and his review of this pen (especially the look of the J. Herbin Violet inside...) really swayed me buy this great pen!
