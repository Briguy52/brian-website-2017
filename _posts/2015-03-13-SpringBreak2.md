Last Wednesday, we had a nice brunch at Monut’s on Ninth Street, just a block down from work. All three of us ordered the ‘Ooey Gooey Gouda’ bagel sandwich (had to get it b/c of the name) as well as a donut. Both Austin and Gabe opted for the Amaretto whereas years of Krispy Kreme samples guided me towards the simple glazed donut.

For the ‘main course’, we had the ‘Ooey Gooey Gouda’ as mentioned before. Mine had a sesame seed bagel, sausage, over easy egg, gouda cheese, and a sweet chutney of some sort. I believe that the sausage and egg were both local or something of the sort, which would explain the $8 price. 

Overall, it’s a cool place (will post some shots of the interior and exterior next time I visit) and well worth dropping by if you’re on Ninth Street.
