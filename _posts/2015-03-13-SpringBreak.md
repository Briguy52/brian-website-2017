College is one long sleepover with everything you could want. There’s classes to feed your mind. Gyms, sports, and trails to feed your body. Game of Thrones marathons to feed your intrigue. And best of all, plenty of friends to feed your hunger for companionship. And best of all, there’s ice cream to feed your ice cream cravings. 

Anyways, what did we do over Spring Break? Too much and too little. 

Let’s go back in time.

Pictured above is a nicely hidden stand of bamboo trees in the Asiatic Pavilion of the Sarah P. Duke Gardens. There was a healthy amount of them and just about half of them were beginning to green. I’d like to say that Spring is here due to the 60-70 degree (20+ Celsius) weather we had for most of break, but the cherry trees, ginger lilies, and other plants of the garden know their time and place. Speaking of which, it’s pretty disappointing to see names and letters carved into some of the stalks… despite the fact that there’s signs (and common sense) discouraging something like that. 

On a brighter note, I still think it’s funny how the #1 thing to do in Durham (according to TripAdvisor) is to visit the Duke Gardens. And not just that- about half of the top 10 are venues associated with Duke, like the Chapel and Cameron Indoor Stadium. Ah, the inseparable Duke and Durham.

A nice (albeit cloudy) view from a painted red bridge. Even though most students haven’t gotten back from Spring Break yet, the flowers have begun to blossom and the Canadian Geese and ducks have returned.
