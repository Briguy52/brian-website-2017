It's always a weird thing to have rain in January. And it's not so much the rain that I mind but the puddles... there's the Randolph puddle, the Tennis Court Bayou, and pretty much the entire West Campus. I could really use a nice pair of rain boots. 

Last night, Austin, Gabe, and I had a great game of Civ V ... until 5:30 in the morning. And I say 'had' even though the game is still ongoing, 130 turns in. But it's a great game in spite of the enormous time sink that it is.
