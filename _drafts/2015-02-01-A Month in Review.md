Health and Exercise

Weightlifting

For this semester, I decided to switch from doing my lax version of Stronglifts 5x5 to the Wendler 5/3/1 program. Seems to be going well. Rather than doing 4 days, I've split it into 3 days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday before classes):

Monday: Squats, Shoulder Press, Accessory Lifts (ie Dips, Pull-ups, Ab stuff)
Wednesday: Bench Press, Bent-over Rows, Accessory
Friday: Deadlift, Weighted Pull-ups and Dips

Cardio

I would like to begin adding in some swimming as well as 1/2 marathon training with Gabriel. Unfortunately, a tendon in his foot is acting up so our Friday afternoon W.A. Duke loops have been put on hold (of course, that's no excuse for my own lack of running). 

Diet

Hmm, not much to say here. Trying to eat more during my meals and less snacks between meals. I'm also planning to avoid purchasing snack items in general (which I've actually done for this month), even though that may be more due to budgeting money towards fountain pens than actual health consciousness. In any way though, it's good that I'm not eating Swedish Fish and Oreos all the time.

Education and Work

Courses

Writing 101 is going well. It's nice having friends in classes where there's discussion. Jenny, Jackie, Ja, Mingchuan, Sarah etc. - all good people that I've talked to before. Physics 151 is also going well in terms of quizzes and homework grades. Haven't been to a lecture in a while (though I can't say I get too much from hearing about Kinematics again...). I'm glad I have Leo in my discussion and my lab group (Jonathan, Tripp, and Thomas) is pretty good as well. Math 216 (Linear Algebra) is alright. It's good that I've already seen the material beforehand though the teaching method here is quite different from Bettina's, from the expectations (calculating all those determinants and row reductions by hand -__-) and the very tedious homework (dang those Maple questions). ECE 110 is alright as well. Lectures are ok and I have Leo, Edward,and Joshua in my lab. Hopefully I become better at using the Arduino and coding in general (but holy cow Edward carries labs so hard).

Extra-Curriculars

Outing Club should be starting up again soon. Always a good thing to go outdoors on the weekends. Study Abroad Committee is also nice- we decided on the Netherlands (Amsterdam) as our destination. Now the planning begins! Talking about committees and planning, I should be joining the ranks of the Hack Duke organizing team soon. Seems like a lot of rewarding work's in store for me with that.

Work

The CT scanner in BioSci has finally been fixed! As such, I should be starting training with it soon (finished my Jamaica specimen renders as well!). Ushering has brought me to some nice events. Particularly enjoyed the Violin recital with Debussy's Violin Sonata as well as the Cello masterclass (got to hear some Schumann). 

Hobbies#

Fountain Pens

Started off with my Golden Star 703 from my parents. Inked it up with some of Gabriel's Noodler's Bulletproof Black. Works great for letters, homework, and note-jotting. Recently got a Pilot Parallel Pen with a 3.8mm nib. Did some very cool Batarde lettering in black, red, and maroon. I should have a TWSBI Diamond 580 (Green!!) with a fine nib, Noodler's Turquoise, ink syringes, a Rhodia No. 18 Dot Pad, and Diamine Med. Blue and Violet ink samples coming in the mail from the Goulet Pen Company. We'll see how they go! I've been particularly enjoying watching Leo Fok's 'Leo Reviews...' series of videos on YouTube. Sbrebrown is great as well. Paul, Mike, and Richard are also into fountain pens which is great. I'll also be writing letters to Jeeho and Richard once my nice paper gets here.

Anime and TV

Hyouka is *awesome*! Seriously- it may be one of my new favorites. The blend of mystery/detective stuff with normal high school anime works out really well. The characters are great as well- Oreki, Mayaka, Chitanda, and Fukube. All different yet not overly stereotypical. In addition, I've been keeping up with Kantai Collection, Tokyo Ghoul 2, and Durarara x2. Alright, I'd say, but nothing spectacular in all honesty. 

Music

Using the H4N Zoom, I recorded a piano track from もやし女 at Biddle. Man, that took a long time to get not only a good take but also to sync it up with everything else in Logic. Since then, I've added some guitar noodling and solos on top of the percussion loops from Logic. 

Civ V

Civ V is a great game... and also a HUGE time sink! I think I logged around 33 hours during MLK weekend (and that's only grown with the big co-op game I had with Austin and Gabe). But very fun and very strategic- like a board game version of Eclipse

Alright, that wraps up the words (or at least most of them)! Pictures in the next post.
