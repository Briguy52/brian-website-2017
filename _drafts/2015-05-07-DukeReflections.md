Well, it’s been a short year and a long year. I can hardly remember the first time I practiced my ‘Randolph-puddle-parkour’ to avoid the waters that would strategically cover the entire entrance to the archway. More recently, with North Carolina’s pollen storms, all of Duke’s puddles, this one included, received curious whitish-yellow swirls of the allergy-inducing stuff. On the topic of pollen, I must include an exchange I happened to eavesdrop upon on move-out day (note: not accurate word-for-word):

>Daughter: Mom, see all that yellow stuff along the wall? That’s pollen!

>Mom: What’s pollen?

>Daughter: It’s the stuff that bees make!

As you can see, Duke is a very diverse school, in more ways than one.

But back on topic- though so much happened, it’s hard for me to look back and really identify what did. I went to classes. I skipped classes. I went to work, avoided inchworm obstacle courses, and painstakingly scanned and rendered fossils dating back to times older than I can imagine and with scientific names too hard for me to pronounce. 

I think life became a routine, a habit. But what of it? For one thing it’s predictable. We crave order, as humans. Now though my dorm room floor would argue otherwise, I do value order in my life. I create weekly schedules, plan out my studying, go to work on certain days and at certain times. Through creating order, we create comfort. And control. I know, more or less, exactly where I should be and what I should be doing at a given time (which usually does not line up with the current status of ‘Location: In Bed, Objective: Sleeping’). But nonetheless, I have a measured out way of living my life. But the flaw of this approach is that this ‘sameness’ all blends together. How many times have I taken the C1x bus from East to West? How many times have I ordered the same Philly Cheese Steak from the Marketplace grill? How many times have I run along the Al Buehler trail in Duke Forest? Too many times to count and too many times to remember each one individually. Now, for the most part, this is unavoidable. I’m not going to take a scooter to class or eat strange vegan food just to spice things up. 

But perhaps I can be more *mindful* of what is going on in my life. We can’t always go on whitewater rafting trips or cook Game of Thrones feasts just to cheer ourselves up and inject excitement into our lives like a shot of espresso. Perhaps what I’m suggesting is a form of acceptance. Accepting the mundane reality of a summer day spent lying on a messy bed, arms folded behind your head. But then taking that time to breathe. Relax. And reflect on all that has happened to you.
