## Duke Robotics

We (the Electrical Team) are currently re-designing our hardware stack and scrapping our old, lopsided, tower (see above) in favor of a new design. We also just opened up the DVL ([Doppler Velocity Log](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_Doppler_current_profiler#Bottom_tracking)) and spec'd out some water-proof cables from SEACON.

## Wearables

I'm working with grad student [Ben Stoddard](https://sites.google.com/site/bcstodds/home) and [Prof. Landon Cox](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~lpcox/) on a wearable 'life-logger' device. The goal is to create an extremely resource-efficient camera badge that only takes pictures when certain conditions are met (using data from an infra-red sensor, light sensor, and accelerometer connected to a Raspberry Pi). 

We just completed the bulk of the hardware stage (lots of soldering and breathing in soldeirng smoke...) and right now I'm using **Blender** to design a hinged case for the device.

## microCT

As part of the [Duke Lemur Center Divison of Fossil Primates](http://lemur.duke.edu/discover/division-of-fossil-primates/), I'm making my way through a batch of tiny bat skulls and jaw bones from the American Museum of Natural History. I cover the process from start to finish (minus the digging for fossils in Egypt part...), beginning by mounting the specimens in foam, scanning them with the microCT, reconstructing the image slices, and then rendering and processing these slices as a polished 3D surface object. This is then uploaded to [MorphoSource](MorphoSource.org) where researchers, students, or curious people anywhere can access and download these scans and models for free. 

## Academics

I'm working my way through **Data Structures and Algorithms**, day by day. We're covering Linked Lists right now and our tasked with completing the DNA assignment. This involves simulating the process of DNA recombination by replacing a given restriction enzyme sequence with a splicee sequence. Other than writing our own Linked List based class, we're also doing a lot of benchmarking to empirically determine the runtime patterns due to a variety of factors (changing memory alloted to Java, size of starting DNA sequences, etc.)
