## Duke Robotics

We (the Electrical Team) are currently re-designing our hardware stack and scrapping our old, lopsided, tower (see above) in favor of a new design. We also just opening up the DVL ([Doppler Velocity Log](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_Doppler_current_profiler#Bottom_tracking)) and spec'd out some really expensive water-proof cables from SEACON.

## Wearables

I'm working with grad student Ben Stoddard and Prof. Landon Cox on a wearable 'life-logger' device. The goal is to create an extremely resource-efficient camera badge that only takes pictures when certain conditions are met (using data from an infra-red sensor, light sensor, and accelerometer connected to a Raspberry Pi). 

We just completed the bulk of the hardware stage (lots of soldering and breathing in soldeirng smoke...) and right now I'm using **Blender** to design a hinged case for the device. 

## School

I'm working my way through **Data Structures and Algorithms**, day by day. We're covering Linked Lists right now and our tasked with completing the DNA assignment. This involves simulating the process of DNA recombination by replacing a given restriction enzyme sequence with a splicee sequence. Other than writing our own Linked List based class, we're also doing a lot of benchmarking to empirically determine the runtime patterns due to a variety of factors (changing memory alloted to Java, size of starting DNA sequences, etc.)
