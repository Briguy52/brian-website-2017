**Background**

I’m part of Alpha Phi Omega, a co-ed social and service group on campus. It’s our mission to make as big a difference as we can on our Durham community, and so we’re constantly looking for new volunteer events to share with our members. We also increase our impact with more members, so we’ve been working on recruitment and getting more Duke students involved.
The design process began in mid July and the finished site will be launching later this week (mid August) in time for the Activities Fair for newly arrived freshman.

**People**

What type of people visit the site? There’s two main types: students who want to join and organizations who want to partner.

A student interested in APO could be an incoming freshman trying to meet new friends, a rising senior wanting to volunteer, or any combination in between. They want to know where we volunteer, how we socialize, and why we exist as an organization. They want to know our traditions, but probably not too much nitty-gritty history unless it’s relevant to what we do today.

A person from an organization wants to share their event or cause with us, and the first thing they’re looking for is the word “Contact” somewhere. They’re probably not interested in our social events, traditions, or history though they might want to see what service events we’ve volunteered at in the past.

**Before**

Our website should help both students and organizations get what they want, and unfortunately, our previous website made that difficult.

**Design and branding issues**

Our Home page looked outdated and only made use of half the screen’s width. Important information such as FAQs, chapter history, and our mission were also hidden within the About page and in no way accessible from the home screen.
In addition, our only form of branding was taking the official Alpha Phi Omega logo and adding “lambda nu”, our chapter name, below. While that may mean something to us or anyone else in APO, it means nothing to a Duke student or a local NGO.
Content issues

There was also no mention of Duke University, Durham, or North Carolina on the home page. Since our volunteer events take place around Durham, location is very important.

We’re also missing examples of past service events and a form of contact. How are organizations going to reach out if we don’t tell them how?

**Goals**

I wanted to design a new website that:
1. Shows all information on a single, scrollable page
2. Updates our branding and iconography
3. Has clear pictures of our social and service events
4. Explains our mission — why do we even exist as an organization?
5. Provides call to actions — contact forms for organizations to fill out and social media for students interested in joining
