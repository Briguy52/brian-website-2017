**Background**

Aloha is the main project I'm working on now with several students from both Duke and UNC. The idea was born out of behavioral econ research done by members of the team, showing that many college students don't complete their first year due to an inability to connect with other students on campus. We've been through typical orientation week conversations where we ask about our majors and hometowns and dorms, but rarely get to learn how we're truly living our lives. The result of these shallow conversations is shallow friendships that aren't able to support us when we need it. Our goal is to create an app that helps students create a habit of starting adventurous conversations. 

As such, all of my design decisions revolved around this central theme of habitual conversation starting.

**Problem: Conversation Starters and Social Risk**

Our original way of starting conversations was to ask each user for a few interests. Things like "food" or "basketball" or "reading". These are great for small talk, but as a form of smalltalk, there's low risk and low reward. Nothing is at stake (unless we're talking Duke basketball of course). Our target audience is students who are having difficulty making the transition from small talk to asking about their personal lives and what matters to them. 

Our solution is throwing them straight into the deep end by replacing shallow interests with "how are you living your life?" type questions. How do we do this without scaring away everyone? A prompt such as "What is something you regret doing in life?" is high risk, high reward in the sense that it's borderline uncomfortable—something you'd never just say to a stranger you walked up to—yet it will reveal a lot about a person and allows them to open up. Our solution is to define a new social norm within the app. So we will combine our deep questions with a simple "social contract" where users agree to several simple points, such as "I agree to make the most of my time", "I will be respectful of other users' beliefs", and "I won't just ask questions I can find the answers to on social media". Users then sign their name on the screen. Having this social contract follows the same principle as our "Duke Community Standard" where everyone agrees to not lie or cheat on exams or coursework.
