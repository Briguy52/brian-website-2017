We collaborated with a SmartCar to bring a Tesla model S to HackDuke this year. It'd give our participants a chance to run their own software or apps on the car.

I created the graphic above to promote the event. I wanted to combine both the recognizable shape of the Tesla model 3 with our own bold color scheme, resulting in the sketches below. From there, I had to choose how much of the car outlines to include and what type of background I wanted, eventually settling on the final design.
