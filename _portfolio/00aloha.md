**Background**

Aloha is the main project I'm working on now with several students from both Duke and UNC. We've all been through typical orientation week conversations where we ask about our majors and hometowns and dorms, but rarely get to learn how we're truly living our lives. Furthermore, starting conversations with strangers is tough! It's not easy approaching others and keeping that conversation going. Our goal with Aloha is to help students create a habit of starting adventurous conversations. 

Other than being able to get some design practice in, I'm really excited about this project because I used to be a host for Tea with Strangers. It's an informal countrywide movement where hosts setup a teatime with up to five other random strangers, and then spend the next two hours talking about anything. We'd talk about anything from classes to how we thought the world would end. Onetime, I even had a teatime with a fellow host where everyone was blindfolded! I really loved the experience, and I'm hoping to recreate it through this project. 

As such, all of my design decisions revolved around this central theme of habitual, open conversation starting.

**Designing for Behavior Change - Conversation Starters and Social Risk**

Our initial approach to conversation starters was to ask each user for a few interests. Things like "food" or "basketball" or "reading". These are great for finding out what people do, but reveal little about who they are and why they're here. These topics are essentially low risk, low reward—nothing is at stake (unless we're talking about Duke basketball). 

Instead, we want people to get deep. We want people to develop a habit of not just starting conversations, but making these conversations matter. We want people to eventually feel comfortable walking up to a complete stranger and asking "How are you living your life?"

But how do we do this without scaring away everyone? A prompt such as "What is something you regret doing in life?" is high risk, high reward. It's borderline uncomfortable—something you'd never just say to a stranger you walked up to—yet it will reveal a lot about who a person is, crucial if you want to develop any lasting relationship. Our solution is to define a new social norm within the app. We combine our deep questions with a simple "social contract" where users agree to several simple points, such as "I agree to make the most of my time", "I will be respectful of other users' beliefs", and "I won't just ask questions I can find the answers to on social media". Users then sign their name on the screen. It's like the community standard at college, where everyone agrees to not lie or cheat on exams or coursework. Signing that sheet puts you under surveillance by yourself. You're primed to check your own behavior and practice what you agreed to. 

**Design Problem: How Do We Make This *Not* a Dating App?**

The problem we're helping our users with is connecting with others and starting meaningful conversations. We didn't want this to turn into another dating app. Well, what makes a dating app a dating app? To answer that, we started by taking a look at dating apps like Tinder or Coffee Meets Bagel. What did we notice? First, you're always presented with a single user at a time. Not only that, but a picture occupies the majority of the screen, whereas name and age appear below. Oftentimes, you can't even see the bio unless you scroll down. 

Our first step was shrinking the picture. We want users to care more about how a person is living their life, than how they look. And so the picture gallery was reduced to a single profile picture, enough to identify you. Bio and background then expand on our screen in relation to their importance. 

Another big change was switching from showing a single profile at a time to a few. Two and a half. A single profile is an example of "narrow bracketing", where you're only shown a small subset of all your choices. In apps like Tinder, you have to decide right away whether you like someone. And there's no going back. That's not what we're going for here. Instead, we go with broad bracketing, where you're able to see several people at a time, and you always have the ability to cycle back to someone who seemed interesting.

**Visuals: Volcano and Adventure Theme**

The name "Aloha" was already decided before I came on, so I can't take any credit for that (even though I love it). I still had the job of creating a theme around it. Aloha evokes Hawaii. That brought up palm trees and islands and coconuts and beaches. From islands, we got the idea of island hopping. We wanted to frame starting conversations as a form of adventure. You start off on your own island. But you're not the only one out there. There's islands to explore and you can go island hopping, from person to person, creating a map or network of people you've met. The adventure theme also makes gamification natural with badges available for specific accomplishments. 

Another feature of our app is the ability to go active when you're trying to meet people, and inactive when you're not. Volcanos made their way onto my "Aloha" brainstorming list, and I decided to go with active/dormant volcanos as a fun visualization of your status. Even better, whenever you start a conversation, the volcano will erupt, celebrating the effort a user takes to start a conversation.
